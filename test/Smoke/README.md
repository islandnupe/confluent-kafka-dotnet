Scripts that set up:
1. A 3 broker kafka cluster (single zookeeper instance).
2. 


## Windows

Kafka does not run reliably under Windows (whether using the .bat scripts included in the distribution,

run Linux in a virtual machine, such as [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). A 
recipe for doing this is provided below.

1. Download and install [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
